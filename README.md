## Project Description

Analyzed time series data sets using various correlation measures to demonstrate how each correlation meaures work and
when you might use one technique over another.

## Objective

This repository contains Julia coded examples, image files, IJulia notebooks and other general materials related
to explaining the use of autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis with time series data.

It includes a presentation deck for a Machine Learning technical meetup, "Learning Tuesdays", a biweekly talk given by a different member of the Akamai mPulse Data Science team. In this open source technical presentation, I hoped to educate the audience on what correlation analysis is and where and how it can play a role in investigating time series data.

## Getting Started

You will need to install Julia and IJulia to utilize the Jupyter notebooks in this repository. Then, clone the repository and you are ready to go.

## Installation Steps

### Install Julia

You will need at least Julia version 1.4.0 or higher.

1. **juliaup**

A recommended way to install Julia is to install [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) which is a small, self-contained binary that will automatically install the latest stable Julia binary and help keep it up to date. It also supports installing and using different versions of Julia simultaneously.

Install `juliaup` by running this in your terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

```

This command will install the latest stable version of Julia, which can be launched from a command-line by typing `julia` as well as the `juliaup` tool. To install different Julia versions see `juliaup --help`.

2. **Downloads**

If you want to manually download and install specific Julia versions, see the [Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/) page.

### Install IJulia to Use Jupyter Notebooks

Install `IJulia` using instructions [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)
